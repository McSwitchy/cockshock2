\section{Hack: Disable the 3-minute auto-shutdown timeout}

A simple modification is replacing the tilt switch in the shock unit by a slow (0.01 Hz to 10 Hz) Oscillator to disable the 3-minute auto-shutdown timeout.

\end{figure}

The oscillator can be built from just three small components: A 74LVC1G14 inverting Schmitt-trigger buffer, a 1 ÂµF capacitor and a 100 k\si{\ohm} resistor (see Figure~\ref{auto-shutdown-timeout-hack}).
